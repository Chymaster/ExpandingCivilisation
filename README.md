# ExpandingCivilisation
### End of year Computing Laboratory assignment

The project builds computational functions useful for the KCL Computer Laboritory Assessment.
## This code does not do anything on itself
Appropriate use of the functions and modification is needed to generate result for End Of Yeah Computational Assessment
This code is only for comparision use, I hope my code can help you expanding your knowledge,
but please **DO NOT CTRL C+V** as it will not work until you understand it.
